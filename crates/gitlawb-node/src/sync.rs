//! Multi-node repo sync worker.
//!
//! When `GITLAWB_AUTO_SYNC=true`, this background task polls the `sync_queue`
//! table and mirrors repos from peer nodes after receiving Gossipsub ref-update
//! events. Each sync item represents one ref update that arrived from a peer.
//!
//! For each pending item:
//!   1. Look up the origin node's HTTP URL from the peer table.
//!   2. If the repo doesn't exist locally → `git clone --mirror`.
//!   3. If it exists → `git fetch --prune` from the origin.
//!   4. Mark done or failed.
//!   5. On success, register ourselves as a replica with the origin node so
//!      its `replica_count` reflects reality (best-effort, idempotent).
