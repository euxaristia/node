//! Centralized repo storage layer — local disk cache backed by Tigris (S3).
//!
//! Every handler that needs access to a git repo on disk goes through `RepoStore`:
//!
//! - `acquire()` — ensures the repo is on local disk (downloads from Tigris on cache miss).
//! - `release_after_write()` — uploads the updated repo to Tigris after a write operation.
//! - `init()` — creates a new bare repo locally and uploads to Tigris.
//!
//! When Tigris is disabled (bucket empty), this is a simple passthrough to local disk.

        //     one. Running them through the pool (`fetch_one(&self.pool)`) lets them land
        //     on different connections: the unlock silently returns false and the lock
        //     leaks, while a competing acquire that happens to draw the holding
        //     connection re-enters the lock and two pushes to one repo run concurrently.
        //     Hence: keep the connection that WON.
        //   * Occupancy. Holding a connection across the ~60 one-second sleeps would let
        //     one spinning acquire park a lock-pool connection for a minute. That is not
        //     just a push-path concern: `api/issues.rs` and `api/pulls.rs` reach
        //     acquire_write holding no concurrency permit at all, so a caller could park

///     lock and wedging every later push to that repo (#173). Note the hook runs
///     from that spawned task, so the unlock is asynchronous with respect to the
///     drop: the lock clears shortly after the connection goes away, not
///     synchronously with it.
///   * It is a SEPARATE pool from the main query pool, not a slice of it. A push
///     holds its lock connection for the whole receive-pack, so drawing these
///     from the main pool would let a burst of `max_concurrent_git_pushes`
