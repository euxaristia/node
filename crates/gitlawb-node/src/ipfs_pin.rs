///   the drop is a filter over the rows this pass already read rather than a second
///   whole-node query. The resolver's legacy scan reads the same rows and drops on the
///   same flag. Private, non-quarantined repos DO stay in the list: an additive source
///   record binds nothing to one repo's ACL, because the resolver gates every source
///   independently at serve time, so probing a private repo leaks nothing.
/// - WARM ONLY. The path is resolved through the repo store's validated resolver and
///   kept only if it is on local disk. Nothing here goes through `repo_store.acquire`:
///   the sweep is opportunistic background maintenance over every pinned row on the
///   node, and pulling cold repos back from remote storage would turn a repair pass
///   into a bulk restore.
/// - UNSAFE PATH. A name that fails the validated resolver is dropped with a warn and
///   is terminal; nothing a later run changes.
///
/// The candidates are ordered oldest-first by `(created_at, id)` rather than by id
/// alone. `repo_id` derives from the owner DID, which anyone can grind, so an id sort
/// would let an attacker register low-sorting repos and push the true holder past the
/// probe cap. Source-less rows predate provenance and their holders are old repos,
/// while freshly registered repos sort last and cannot be backdated. That order is now
/// the QUERY's (`ORDER BY created_at ASC, id ASC`, index-backed by migration v25) and
/// pages concatenate in it, so the list is globally sorted as it is built and no

/// content CID and withholds any row whose key does not match, so those rows are

/// when a later push re-carries the object, and normal git negotiation omits objects
/// the node already has, so on an upgraded node that push generally never comes. This
/// walks the table instead.
///
/// A row with NO recorded source is the pre-provenance case this exists for, so it is
/// not skipped: the pass probes a bounded, quarantine-filtered set of WARM local repos
/// for the object (at most [`MAX_LEGACY_DISCOVERY_PROBES`] reads per row, each row
/// taking a [`DISCOVERY_ROW_BUDGET_DIVISOR`] slice of the pass's one discovery deadline)
/// and, on a hit, rewrites the key from the verified bytes and
/// records the discovered repo ADDITIVELY alongside the incomplete marker. It never
/// writes an exclusive first-pinner claim and never pulls a cold repo back from remote
/// storage. See `discover_legacy_row` for why both of those matter.
///
/// Runs until a pass comes back short of a full batch, which is the end of the table.
/// Sleeps `delay` between full batches so it cannot monopolize the DB, and persists
/// its cursor every pass so a restart continues instead of rewinding. Errors reading
/// or repairing an individual row are warn-and-skip; only a failure of the batch query
/// or the cursor write ends the run, and a later run picks up from the stored cursor.
///
/// A run that REACHES THE END OF THE TABLE rewinds the cursor to the start on its way
/// out, so the next run walks the whole table again (#173 rounds 11 and 12). Without
/// that the cursor parked at the maximum `sha256_hex` for good and every later boot
/// read zero rows, which stranded two different kinds of row: one skipped for a
/// transient reason (its repo cold on a Tigris-backed node, a DB or object read error),
/// and one written BELOW the parked cursor afterwards by another node mid-rolling-
/// upgrade. Either way the row was unadvertised and unresolvable with nothing left to
/// fix it.
///
/// Round 11 gated the rewind on a transient skip having happened. That could not cover
/// the second case, because the run that parks the cursor is a clean one by definition:
/// the row it strands does not exist yet. So the rewind is unconditional on completion.
///
/// It is a per-RUN decision made after the walk has finished, never mid-walk, so it
/// cannot spin. The cost is one extra ordered scan per run, plus a repair attempt for
/// each row that is unrepairable in principle (bytes gone, provenance gone): the read is
/// attempted before the bytes are found missing. Those reads are the one cost that does
/// not shrink as the migration progresses, so `MAX_DEAD_ROW_READS_PER_RUN` bounds them
/// per run and the run stops early rather than paying `O(dead rows)` on every boot. A
/// row already carrying the canonical raw key costs a codec decode and no read at all,
/// so a node that has finished repairing pays the scan and nothing more.
///
/// A run that stops on a pass ERROR does NOT rewind: its cursor is mid-table and

/// (#173).
///
/// # What `batch_budget` does and does not bound
///
/// The loop holds a `pin_semaphore` permit and that pool defers rather than
/// sheds, so the hold has to be bounded by something other than the pusher's
/// object count. Four things here are:
///
/// - this loop's own wall-clock: the deadline is taken once at loop start and
///   checked at the top of every iteration, so no object's work begins with less
///   than [`PIN_READ_FLOOR`] left. It is a gate, not a hard ceiling, since a started
///   iteration still runs to completion;
/// - the git read: `store::read_object_bounded` runs under `spawn_blocking` against the
///   ABSOLUTE batch deadline (not the loop-top remainder, which the `is_pinned` round-trip
///   sitting between the two would push past it), with SIGTERM-then-SIGKILL
///   process-group teardown, so a hung `git cat-file` costs this batch its remaining
///   budget plus one watchdog teardown instead of holding the permit for the child's
///   whole lifetime and blocking a runtime worker while it does;
/// - each HTTP add: `pin_git_object` is handed the remainder measured AFTER the read
///   as its per-request timeout, which is what lets one large healthy upload run past
///   the shared client's 10s default without letting the batch run forever. Measuring
///   it after the read is what keeps the read-plus-add pair inside one budget rather
///   than up to two of them;
/// - the DB round-trips: every DB operation reachable from inside the region is
///   bounded by the same absolute deadline through [`db_bounded`], including the two
///   inside `repair_legacy_provider_cid`, which the loop body's own call sites do not
///   show. `retry_db_record` is wrapped as a whole so its ladder cannot multiply one
///   remainder, and the durability writes (the post-add record, the skip branch's
///   source record and its incomplete marker) take the floored remainder
///   `max(remaining, DB_RECORD_GRACE)` so a spent budget delays the permit release
///   rather than dropping a write. A bound is not a rollback, and what an elapsed
///   bound MEANS is a property of the operation, so each site maps that arm from the
///   shape of the call it wrapped: a multi-statement transaction whose `tx.commit()`
///   is never reached definitely did not land and is compensated like a definite
///   error, while a single autocommit statement may still land server-side and is
///   never treated as a failed write. See [`BoundedDbError::Elapsed`].
///
/// So the LOOP's hold is bounded by roughly `batch_budget` plus one teardown plus the
/// record graces one iteration can chain. `db_record_deadline` re-floors from
/// `Instant::now()` at EVERY call, so the graces inside a single iteration add up
/// rather than sharing one floor: this loop's worst case is the skip branch at
/// `deadline + 4s` (the source record, then its incomplete marker). It does NOT stack
/// per object, because the next iteration's first statement is `batch_budget_gate`,
/// which breaks the batch, so the overrun is one iteration's worth however many
/// objects the push carried. Against the 120s `PIN_BATCH_BUDGET` that is roughly a 5%
/// overrun for the batch, not an unbounded hold. One thing inside that region still is
/// not bounded at all, and the gate cannot fix it:
///
/// - the pool. `api::repos` acquires the same `pin_semaphore` for the Pinata
///   replication task and holds it across `pinata_object_list_for_refs`, a full git
///   re-derivation that runs BEFORE `pinata::pin_new_objects` is entered and whose
///   per-child timeouts carry no aggregate deadline. What is bounded is each pin
///   loop's own hold, not the permit's total hold and not the semaphore's worst-case
///   queue.
///
/// # Truncation semantics
///
/// A batch stopped at the deadline leaves its remaining objects unpinned, and
/// nothing sweeps them up afterwards. There is no reconciliation pass over
/// `pinned_cids`; recovery is opportunistic, happening only if some later push
/// on the repo takes the full-scan fallback (`push_delta::list_all_objects`) and
/// re-derives the whole object set, which then re-offers the skipped OIDs.
///
/// The twin in `pinata.rs` is back at parity on everything that bounds or repairs an
/// object: it runs the same shared budget gate at the top of every iteration, the same
/// bounded and reaped git read against the earlier of the batch deadline and
/// `git_timeout`, and the same opportunistic legacy provider-CID repair on its skip
/// branch. It still has no per-request override, since `pinata::pin_object` takes no
/// timeout argument and its uploads are bounded by the shared client's own ceiling.
/// Everything else about the shape (the skip-if-pinned check, the provenance recording,
/// the fault arms) changes in lockstep. The returned pairs are the one deliberate
/// exception: this side omits an object whose DB record exhausted its retries, because
/// the return here is consumed for logging only, while the pinata side still returns it
/// because its return feeds the announcement `cid_map`. See the record step for the
/// reasoning.
///
/// Returns a list of `(sha256_hex, cid)` pairs pinned AND durably recorded this
/// call.

// (`repo_id`) sit alongside #174's batch budget. All four callers pass every one, and
