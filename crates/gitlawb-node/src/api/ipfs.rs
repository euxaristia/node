//! GET /ipfs/{cid} — content-addressed retrieval of git objects by CIDv1.
//!
//! Every git object pinned on this node is addressable by its IPFS CIDv1.
//! The CID is computed as:
//!
//!   CIDv1(codec=raw, multihash=sha2-256(content_bytes))
//!
//! where `content_bytes` is the raw object content as returned by
//! `git cat-file <type> <sha256>` (i.e. without the git framing header) — the
//! same bytes `gitlawb_core::cid::Cid::from_git_object_bytes` hashes when the
//! object is pinned. That digest is NOT the object's git oid: git frames the
//! content with a `"<type> <len>\0"` header before hashing, so `sha2-256(content)`
//! and the git oid differ. The handler therefore maps the CID back to its oid via
//! the `pinned_cids` table rather than treating the digest as an oid (#173).
//!
//! Serving is access-controlled: an object is returned only from a repo row the
//! requesting caller is permitted to read (per-caller path-scoped visibility,
//! see `get_by_cid`).

    //     (#174 F5/U4). A retry cannot fix it, and a 503 here would invite a conformant
    //     client to retry-storm a fresh `cat-file` per attempt against the broken repo.
    //     Gated on nothing else having tainted: when a transient skip co-occurs, the
    //     object may live in the repo that was skipped transiently, so a retry CAN
    //     surface it and the retryable 503 below is the honest answer. The body is
    //     opaque; the raw git detail was logged at the probe and never reaches the client.
    //  2. The scan was cut short (a cap, the request budget, or a transient stage
    //     failure), so the object was NOT proven absent/unreadable everywhere → 503,
    //     retryable, and explicitly NOT a definitive not-found (#173 F2). This outranks
    //     the throttle: an incomplete search must not masquerade as a clean rate-limit
    //     outcome. The message names the truncation sources so an operator can map the
    //     shed to the right knob or backend, and carries no object/OID/metadata. When a
    //     ceiling was the cut, the shed also carries the sealed continuation the caller
    //     echoes as `?scan=` to resume.
    //
    //     ONE deliberate exception to that precedence (#173 round 13, F2): the legacy
    //     scan's PAGE toll breaks the pager WITHOUT tainting, so a request stopped only
    //     by its own spent work bucket falls through to the 429 below rather than the
    //     503 here. The reason is that a 503 says "the node's search was cut short,
    //     retry" and invites an immediate retry straight back into the same empty
    //     bucket; a 429 names what actually stopped the caller and carries the honest
    //     wait. Their previously issued token is still valid, so the retry after the
    //     refill resumes rather than restarts. A request that tainted for any OTHER
    //     reason and then also ran its bucket dry still lands here, per the ordering
    //     as written.
    //  3. A walk-requiring candidate was skipped for a spent IP quota while the scan
    //     otherwise completed → 429 (the brake bit; a cheaper copy was sought first).
    //  4. A full scan under the caps found nothing readable → opaque 404, uniform with
