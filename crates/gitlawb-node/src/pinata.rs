/// still needed to read each object's bytes, and `git_bin` names the binary those
/// reads run: the production caller passes the literal `"git"`, and a test passes a
/// fake so the loop's own bound can be driven with a git that never answers.
/// `git_timeout` is the per-object read bound, the same value and the same role it has
/// in the twin: it bounds both the pin read and the skip branch's opportunistic repair.
/// Objects already recorded with a `pinata_cid` are skipped, and `repo_id` records the
/// pin's provenance (#173). Returns `(sha_hex, provider_cid)` pairs for each newly
/// pinned object: the provider CID is the Pinata gateway CID (used for branch->CID
/// recording and ref-update gossip), NOT the raw resolver-key CID stored in
/// `pinned_cids.cid`.
///
/// # What `batch_budget` does and does not bound
///
/// The loop runs under a `pin_semaphore` permit and that pool defers rather than
/// sheds, so the hold has to be bounded by something other than the pusher's object
/// count. Three things here are:
///
/// - this loop's own wall-clock: the deadline is taken once at loop start and
///   checked at the top of every iteration, so no object's work begins with less
///   than the read floor left. It is a gate, not a hard ceiling, since a started
///   iteration still runs to completion;
/// - the git read: `store::read_object_bounded` runs under `spawn_blocking` against the
///   earlier of the ABSOLUTE batch deadline (not the loop-top remainder, which the
///   `has_pinata_cid` round-trip sitting between the two would push past it) and this
///   object's own `git_timeout`, with SIGTERM-then-SIGKILL process-group teardown, so a
///   hung `git cat-file` costs this batch one `git_timeout` plus one watchdog teardown
///   instead of holding the permit for the child's whole lifetime and blocking a runtime
///   worker while it does;
/// - the DB round-trips: every DB operation reachable from inside the region is
///   bounded by the same absolute deadline through `crate::ipfs_pin::db_bounded`,
///   including the two inside `repair_legacy_provider_cid`, which this loop body's own
///   call sites do not show. `retry_db_record` is wrapped as a whole so its ladder
///   cannot multiply one remainder, and the durability writes (the post-upload
///   `record_pinata_cid` and source record, the skip branch's source record, and both
///   incomplete markers) take the floored remainder `max(remaining, DB_RECORD_GRACE)`
///   so a spent budget delays the permit release rather than dropping a write. That
///   floor matters more here than on the twin: `pinned.push` is unconditional, so a
///   dropped record would leave `api::repos` advertising a CID the resolver 404s. A
///   bound is not a rollback, and what an elapsed bound MEANS is a property of the
///   operation, so each site maps that arm from the shape of the call it wrapped. Both
///   source-record sites wrap `record_pin_source`, an explicit transaction whose
///   `tx.commit()` a cancelled future never reaches, so a timeout there definitely did
///   not land and both write the incomplete marker exactly as the definite-error arm
///   does. `record_pinata_cid` is a single autocommit upsert, so ITS timeout is a
///   genuine unknown outcome and is never treated as a failed write. See
///   `crate::ipfs_pin::BoundedDbError::Elapsed`.
///
/// So the LOOP's hold is bounded by roughly `batch_budget`, plus one watchdog
/// teardown, one upload (the shared client's whole-request timeout bounds the
/// upload; `pin_object` takes no per-request override), and the record graces one
/// iteration can chain. `db_record_deadline` re-floors from `Instant::now()` at EVERY
/// call, so the graces inside a single iteration add up rather than sharing one floor:
/// the worst case here is the add path at `deadline + 6s` (`record_pinata_cid`, then
/// `record_pin_source`, then its incomplete marker), against the skip branch's
/// `deadline + 4s`. It does NOT stack per object, because the next iteration's first
/// statement is `batch_budget_gate`, which breaks the batch, so the overrun is one
/// iteration's worth however many objects the push carried. Against the 120s
/// `PIN_BATCH_BUDGET` that is roughly a 5% overrun for the batch, not an unbounded
/// hold. The PERMIT's hold is NOT bounded by any of this, and that stays out of
/// scope: `api::repos` acquires the permit (repos.rs ~2688) and only then re-derives
/// the object list with `pinata_object_list_for_refs` (~2697), BEFORE this function is
/// entered, and that walk carries no aggregate deadline. What is bounded is this
/// loop's own hold, not the permit's total hold and not the semaphore's worst-case
/// queue.
///
/// The twin in `ipfs_pin.rs` is at parity with this loop on everything that bounds or
/// repairs an object: the shared budget gate, the read bounded by the earlier of the
/// batch deadline and `git_timeout`, the skip branch's opportunistic legacy
/// provider-CID repair, and the DB bound above, which is the SAME helper and the same
/// floor on both sides rather than a copy. Change them in lockstep: the
/// skip-if-pinned check, the provenance and source recording, the fault arms, and the
/// budget handling.
///
/// The RETURNED PAIRS are the one deliberate divergence, and it is not drift. This side
/// pushes a pin whose DB record exhausted its retries, because this return is a real
/// input: `api::repos` builds the sha-to-cid `cid_map` from it, which drives
/// `upsert_branch_cid` and the p2p `publish_ref_update` gossip CID. The twin's return is
/// log-only, so it omits a record-failed pin rather than logging a pin the resolver
/// cannot serve. Moving this side to match would need that consumer moved first.
// Ten arguments, over clippy's threshold: the three the budget and the git seam add
// (`git_bin`, `git_timeout`, `batch_budget`) plus #173's `repo_id` are what put the read
