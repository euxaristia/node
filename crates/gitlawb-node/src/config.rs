/// serve-path crash rather than a very long timeout. Bounding at parse time keeps every
/// derived duration in range at once, instead of hardening each site as it is found.
///
/// The ceiling is representability, NOT a policy view of a sane timeout, and that
/// distinction is what sets the number. The help text has always told operators to set
/// this very large to disable the bound, so values like `999999999` (~31 years) are

/// setting while staying a factor of about 5.85 under the ~584-year ceiling of a
/// `u64`-nanosecond `Instant`, which is the tightest representation on any platform we
/// build for. Every value that worked before still parses; only the ones that would have
